    This server provides comprehensive access to USA government spending data through the
    USAspending.gov API.

    ## Quick Tool Selection Guide:

    **"Which agency spent the most on [category] in FY2023?"**
    → Use search_spending_explorer() with type="agency" or type="object_class"

    **"Show me the largest contracts awarded by [agency]"**
    → Use search_spending_by_award() with agencies filter and award_type_codes=["A","B","C","D"]

    **"How much did [state/county] receive in federal spending?"**
    → Use search_spending_by_geography() with appropriate geo_layer and geo_layer_filters

    **"Who are the top contractors/recipients of federal money?"**
    → Use search_recipients() with award_type filter

    **"What are the details of contract XYZ?"**
    → Use search_spending_by_award() with award_ids filter

    ## Tool Categories & When to Use:

    ### 🔍 REFERENCE TOOLS (Always Start Here)

    ## Decision Matrix:

    | Question Type | Primary Tool | Secondary Tools |
    |---------------|-------------|-----------------|
    | Agency spending totals/rankings | search_spending_explorer | get_agencies |
    | Individual contract details | search_spending_by_award | get_award_types |
    | Geographic spending distribution | search_spending_by_geography | - |
    | Company/recipient analysis | search_recipients | search_spending_by_award |
    | Agency organizational structure | get_sub_components_list | list_program_activities |
    | Spending category breakdowns | search_spending_explorer (object_class) | - |

    ## Common Mistakes to Avoid:

    ❌ **Don't use search_spending_by_award for "which agency spent the most"**
    ✅ **Use search_spending_explorer instead**

    ❌ **Don't use search_spending_explorer for individual contract details**  
    ✅ **Use search_spending_by_award instead**

    ❌ **Don't forget to get agency codes first**
    ✅ **Start with get_agencies() to find correct agency names/codes**

    ## Key Parameters:

    ### Time Periods:
    - **FY 2024:** 2023-10-01 to 2024-09-30 (default)
    - **FY 2023:** 2022-10-01 to 2023-09-30
    - Format: YYYY-MM-DD

    ### Award Types:
    - **A:** BPA (Blanket Purchase Agreement)
    - **B:** IDV (Indefinite Delivery Vehicle)  
    - **C:** Contract
    - **D:** Grant
    - **Use get_award_types() for complete list**

    ### Object Classes (for spending_explorer):
    - **"20":** Contractual services and supplies (most contracts)
    - **"10":** Personnel compensation and benefits
    - **"30":** Acquisition of assets
    - **"40":** Grants and fixed charges

    ### Geographic Codes:
    - **States:** Use 2-letter postal codes (CA, TX, NY)
    - **Counties:** Use 5-digit FIPS codes (06037 for Los Angeles County)
    - **Districts:** Use state + district (CA12, TX01)
    - **ZIP:** Use 5-digit ZIP codes (90210, 20500)

    ## Best Practices:

    1. **Always start with reference tools** to get proper agency names and codes
    2. **Match tool to question type** using the decision matrix above
    3. **Use appropriate pagination** (default 100, increase for comprehensive results)
    4. **Verify agency names** - use exact names from get_agencies()
    5. **For contract analysis,** object class "20" captures most contract spending
    6. **For geographic analysis,** choose place_of_performance vs recipient_location carefully

    ## Performance Tips:
    - Limit award details requests to 10 awards per call
    - Use fetch_all_pages=True cautiously with max_pages limits
    - Start with smaller date ranges for large queries

    Always provide clear, actionable insights based on the spending data retrieved.
